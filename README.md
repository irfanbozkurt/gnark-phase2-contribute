For a contributor, only relevant file in this repo is `contribute.sh`. If you're one, safely ignore the rest.

## Prerequisites

## Performing a Contribution

Each contributor will receive a `passkey` that needs to be entered to the executable. This passkey allows to get an upload url.

```bash
chmod +x contribute.sh; ./contribute.sh;
```
